# Computer-Architecture
This repository shows prominent exercises from Computer Architecture course I participated in Bar Ilan University.
Main goal is to understand Computer Architecture from ground up, in order to achieve exercises goals it is required an in-depth knowledge of the computer resources, using it correctly and efficiently.

- Exercise 3 - Implementation of P-String using Assembler <br/>
- Exercise 5 - Code Optimization <br/>
&emsp; Using optimization techniques: <br/>
&emsp; &emsp; - Avoiding expensive calculations (pointers arithmetics, multiply, etc). <br/>
&emsp; &emsp; - Understanding memory layout and multi-dimensional arrays format. <br/>
&emsp; &emsp; - Loop unrolling. <br/>
&emsp; &emsp; - Code motion. <br/>
&emsp; &emsp; - Reducing function calls to minimum. <br/>
&emsp; &emsp; - Using macros. <br/>
